		 <p>
		 	Fishing was a part of me for 19 years. I like to go out fishing even if we don't catch anything, it is relaxing to get out of the house away from problems.

		 <p>
		 	I have joined Sea Rescue to learn new skills and be with other people my age. Every time I step foof in our station then I a meet someone new or learn something. The skills I learn can I use everywhere I go.

		 <p>
		 	Every Saturday me and my friend would go to the beach and catchs a wave. Its is fun to right a wave but also dangerous if there is bad weather or sharks swimming near the beach. Its beter to be in group if you just start surfing, because they can give tips or help you if shark attacks you.
